We also do our best to avoid unnecessary and irrelevant advertising to show. Therefore, we use some of your information in order to ensure that the appropriate ads are delivered to users in a timely manner. For example, For example, if you're interested in gaming and you watch game contents a lot, you might see ads related to it. But if an ad isn’t relevant to you or you don’t think it belongs on the lockscreen, you can always report the ad by tapping ⋮ to block it.

Advertisers can use usage information through cookies or mobile advertising identifiers, device information and location data for ad targeting. However, now that this information is anonymized, no one can identify a specific user through it. Also, no advertiser is able to collect sensitive information such as religion, sexual orientation, or health to serve ads.


Reward

If you participate in the ads shown on the lock screen (click, install, like, etc.), you will receive points equal to the agreed amount in rewards. Using the information to identify users, we track the activities to avoid abuse and pay without missing points. So this information may be partially available to third-party advertisers' sites and apps. In addition, Buzzvil is committed to detecting and preventing fraudulent ad manipulations.

For example, if you frequently see football-related content, you may see more stories about football or the World Cup. And if you follow or hide a channel, the content on that channel will be shown first or excluded.
